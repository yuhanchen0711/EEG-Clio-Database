# Clio Database
## Introduction
  Clio is a automatic lab system designed by former CMU PhD student named Adarsh Dave, which consists of series of programmable pumps, valves, and instruments intersperse tubing to control fluid flow and characterize fluid within a closed volume. The database is part of a pipeline, which is used to store all the data of properties of fluid from the pipeline.
## Access
  The current database can only be accessed locally. It is planned to be uploaded onto AWS.
